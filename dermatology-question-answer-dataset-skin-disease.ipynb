Because of its rarity and the fact that its symptoms can resemble other skin conditions, it can sometimes be challenging to diagnose. Therefore, it's crucial to see a healthcare professional, like a dermatologist, if you notice persistent or unusual skin changes.       0.00      0.00      0.00       0.0\n",

However, it may be associated with certain conditions like diabetes, thyroid disease, and autoimmune diseases. Some cases have been linked to injuries or sun exposure. It's a benign skin condition where a rash forms in ring-shaped bumps on the skin, usually on the hands and feet. It's non-contagious and generally self-resolving, but if it causes discomfort or distress, medical treatments can be pursued.       0.00      0.00      0.00       1.0\n",

Oral medications, like gabapentin or pregabalin, are sometimes prescribed for severe pruritus. If these treatments prove ineffective, phototherapy or immunosuppressant drugs may be considered.

This damage can result from exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light from the sun. In people with XP, the body is unable to repair the damage caused by UV light effectively, leading to increased skin sensitivity to sunlight and a higher risk of skin cancer. As xeroderma pigmentosum is an autosomal recessive disorder, it is inherited when an individual receives two mutated copies of the gene, one from each parent.       0.00      0.00      0.00       0.0\n",

The infection can spread to your lymph nodes and bloodstream, potentially leading to a life-threatening condition called sepsis. Rarely, the infection can also spread to the deep layer of tissue called the fascial lining. This serious condition is called necrotizing fasciitis, or flesh-eating strep.\n",

The red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery scales is the hallmark symptom of this condition. The itchiness and burning sensation is also common with psoriasis. However, to confirm whether it's psoriasis or not, please consult with a dermatologist. They may suggest treatments like topical creams, light therapy, or systemic medications based on the severity of your condition.       0.00      0.00      0.00       1.0\n",
